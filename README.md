# Music-Player

A music player website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to play and control audio directly in their web browser. Here's a breakdown of how these technologies work together:

HTML Structure:

HTML provides the foundation or skeleton of the website. It defines the different sections of the music player, such as the play/pause button, volume control, song title, and progress bar.
Elements like <audio> are used to embed the audio files into the webpage.
CSS Styling:

CSS breathes life into the HTML structure by adding visual design. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall aesthetics of the music player.
You can use CSS to style buttons, position elements, and create a visually appealing user interface.
JavaScript Functionality:

JavaScript brings the music player to life by adding interactivity. It allows you to write code that:
Plays, pauses, and stops the audio.
Adjusts the volume.
Seeks through the song using a progress bar.
Navigates between songs in a playlist.
Updates the user interface based on playback status (playing, paused, etc.).
Overall Functionality:

A basic music player website might include features like:

Play and pause buttons
Progress bar to see how far through the song you are
Volume control
Song title and artist information
A button to switch to the next or previous song in a playlist
